# Welcome to Codespaces

Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live in the Simple Browser pane to the right of your code!

## Your Project

#### ← Getting Started with Codespaces:

- Create a GitHub account
- Fork this repo. Your parent or a volunteer can help with this step.

#### ← Find the HTML Code
- Can you find the difference between a *file* and a *folder*?
- Explore all of the different files and notice what comes after the `.`
- Find the file `index.html` in the `sandbox` folder
- You may need to click the arrow to expand the folder

#### → View the Result
- The pane on the right shows our code as a user would see it
- Don't see the pane? Refresh your browser or close the browser and spin up Codespaces again.
- Click on the <b>Change URL</b> button (top right) and change it to `/sandbox` (don't click the "reset" button)

#### ⟷ Change the HTML Code - What Happens?
- Find the header tag in the `index.html` file in the `sandbox` folder and change the words inside
- What happens on the right?
- Play around with different tags to find out what they do

#### ⟷ Change the CSS Code - What Happens?
- Find the file `style.css` in the `sandbox` folder
- Find a color in the `style.css` file and change the name of the color
- What happens on the right?
- Play around with different tags to find out what they do

#### ← Bonus:
- When would I need to use the `assets` folder?
- What would happen if I replaced the h1 color from *#373fff* to *green* in the `style.css` file?
- Rename your `<insert your name>.html` file to your favorite type of food. What else do you need to change now?

### ← index.html

This is what shows if you do not specify a specific page name.
 
### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### ← script.js

If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
