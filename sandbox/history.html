        History of Richmond
      </h2>
      <p>
        The history of Richmond, Virginia, as a modern city, dates to the early
        17th century, and is crucial to the development of the colony of
        Virginia, the American Revolutionary War, and the Civil War. After
        Reconstruction, Richmond's location at the falls of the James River
        helped it develop a diversified economy and become a land transportation
        hub.

      <h3>
        Civil War History
      </h3>
      <p>
        In February 1861, Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as President of the
        Confederate States of America in Montgomery, Alabama. Two months after
        Davis' inauguration, the Confederate army fired on Fort Sumter in
        Charleston, South Carolina, and the Civil War had begun. With the
        outbreak of war, followed by Virginia's secession in May 1861, the
        strategic location of the Tredegar Iron Works was one of the primary
        factors in the decision to relocate the capital of the Confederacy to
        Richmond. From this arsenal came much of the Confederates' heavy
        ordnance machinery, making 723 tons of armor plating that covered the
        CSS Virginia, the world's first ironclad used in the two-day Battle of
        Hampton Roads in March 1862, against the USS Monitor.
